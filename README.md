**Student Name:** Gillian Kane-McLoughlin  
**Student Number:** G00398258  


README file for my practical assignment for the Programming for Data Analysis module, due 22nd November 2021.  


### **Repository Contents**  
- 1 x README.md file  
- 1 x .gitignore file  
- 1 x Jupyter Notebook (entitled progda_assignment.ipynb)  


### **Software Information**  
The code for this assignment was written in Python (version 3.8.8) and ran in a Jupyter Notebook.  


**Jupyter Version:**  
jupyter core     : 4.7.1  
jupyter-notebook : 6.3.0  
qtconsole        : 5.0.3  
ipython          : 7.22.0  
ipykernel        : 5.3.4  
jupyter client   : 6.1.12  
jupyter lab      : 3.0.14  
nbconvert        : 6.0.7  
ipywidgets       : 7.6.3  
nbformat         : 5.1.3  
traitlets        : 5.0.5  


### **Modules Required to Run this Jupyter Notebook**  
This notebook begins by importing the following modules:  
`import numpy as np`  
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`  
`import seaborn as sns`  
`import time`  


### **What Does this Notebook do?**  
This notebook addresses the following four tasks:  
1. Explain the overall purpose of the numpy.random package in Python  
2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions  
3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions  
4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers  


- #### **Task 1: Explain the overall purpose of the package**  
In this first section of the notebook, I begin by giving a summary of the overall purpose of NumPy, the random module, and how random numbers are generated.   


- #### **Task 2: Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions**  
Task 2 is split into 2 sections. In section a) I list the differnt functions available for generating simple random data, detailing the paramaters and outputs of each as per the official NumPy documentation and provide code examples of the functions in use.  
I then move onto section b) which details the two permutations functions and again detail the parameters & outputs of each as per NumPy.org and provide examples of both.  


- #### **Task 3: Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions**  
The five distribution functions discussed in this notebook are as follows:  

1. Normal Distribution  
2. Uniform Distribution  
3. Pareto Distribution  
4. Binomial Distribution  
5. Multinomial Distribution  

The use and purpose of each distribution is discussed, and a histogram of each distribution is plotted.  


- #### **Task 4: Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudo-random numbers**  
In this section, I discuss the meaning of pseudo-random numbers, what seeds are and how they are used.  
I provide examples of how code to generate random numbers can be reproduced with the same results if the seed is shared, and how different random numbers are generated if a seed is not explicitly set.  


The notebook concludes with a brief summary and a comprehensive list of all references referred to and consulted over the course of completing this assignment.
