This notebook begins by giving a summary of the overall purpose of NumPy, the random module, and how random numbers are generated.  
It then goes through the functions available for generating simple random data, detailing the paramaters and outputs of each as per the official NumPy documentation and provides examples of the functions in use, before moving on to the permutations functions.
